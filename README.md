Hi there!

I am a Mainly Rust Developer and I like making projects right now tho, I am mainly looking at other repo's and converting them
to rust to get my grip on Rust to be a bit stronger and also to influence ideas for the future, so right now
most my current projects arn't full proper consumer products and are just tests.. for now.
